    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Innovative and solution-driven product manager, my background in engineering has given me the advantage of having an
        analytical and problem-solving mindset. I have spent the last year honing and improving my product management skills by
        working on various products, conducting product teardowns and generally looking for new ways to solve user problems.
        While working on different products, I drew up product requirement documents and product strategies to clearly define the
        business goals and align them to user needs and problems.</p>
